django-helpdesk was originally written by David Bujosa. After nearly nine
years under his guidance, the project graduated to its own eponymous
organization, and is currently maintained by:

David Bujosa (@bujosa)

Since publishing the code a number of people have made some fantastic
improvements and provided bug fixes and updates as the Django codebase
has moved on and caused small portions of this application to break.

To these people, and many more, our sincere thanks:

David Bujosa
Yordi Ogando
Jeremy Martinez
Pedro Mendoza
